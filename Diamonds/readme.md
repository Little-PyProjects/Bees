# Diamonds

I came across this dataset a while back while looking through the Harvard Business School's website. It was titled "Sarah gets a diamond". Two things came to mind. The first was that it would be good for a regression model. The second is harder for me to pin down. Part of it has to do with how odd picking out an engagement ring would be based strictly off the numbers. I get price because not everyone is of substantial means or can bank on high earning potential earnings, like the HBS grads can. The other is how very traditional this all is.

Still, it's a good dataset.
