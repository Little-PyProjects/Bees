# Diamonds

I came across this dataset a while back while looking through the Harvard Business School's website. It was titled "Sarah gets a diamond". Two things came to mind. The first was that it would be good for a regression model. The second is harder for me to pin down. Part of it has to do with how odd picking out an engaugement ring would be based strictly off the numbers. I get price because not everyone is of substanial means or can bank on high earning potiential earnings, like the HBS grads can. The other is how very tradtional this all is.

Still, it's a good dataset.
