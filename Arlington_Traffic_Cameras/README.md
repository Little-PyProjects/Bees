## Description and Why:
I was casting about looking for an interesting data source. While this isn't it, it struck me as as interesting enough for a short data display project.

## Contents:
 - First draft with Jupyter Notebook. Pending any additional data source being made availabe (e.g., camera status or video), I think I'm done with this.
